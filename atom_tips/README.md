### Creating A Quick Project

> [VISUAL STEPS](visual_new_project.md)

Let's create a quick `bird_site` project.

  * Click the [**Atom**](atom://atom) icon in your doc.
  * Hit `CMD + O` or go to `File > Open...` in your menubar.
  * Navigate to a folder directory you are familiar with. It might be easier for you to find your project later if you go to the `Documents` or `Desktop` directories.

  * Then click the `New Folder` option.
  * Provide the name of your project, `bird_site`, and click `create`.
  * Select your project folder and click the `Open` button.


Following these steps atom should open your new project folder.

### Adding Files and Subfolders

* Click the left hand project **tree view**.
* **New File**: Hit `a` you will be asked for the name of the new file.
  * Create one named `index.html`.
* **New Folder**: Click the left hand tree view and hit **shift + a**.
  * Create a new folder called `public`.
* **Populating Folders**: if you click the newly created `public` folder and hit `a` you should be prompted to create a file in `public/`.
  * Add a file: `public/app.css`
* **Nesting Folders**: If you click the `public` folder and hit `shift + a` then you should be prompted to create a subfolder in `public/`.
  * Add a folder: `public/styles`
* **Drag and Drop**: In atom your can drag the `public/app.css` file and drop it in the `public/styles` folder.
