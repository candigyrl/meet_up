# Day 6
## Intro Control Flow

Previously we were introduced to variable declarations and initializations. We all took a look at some operators: `!`, `!==`, `===`.


| Objectives |
| :---- |
| Utilize operators and conditionals to write simple control flow. |
| Familiarize ourselves with Arrays and how to add and remove items. |
| Utilize loops and iterators to repeatedly apply a procedure. |


## Projects

Try the project for variables and conditionals. Do as many as you can. Afterward compare and discuss solutions with your partner using the provided solutions.
